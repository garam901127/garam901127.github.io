Women's lacrosse (or girl's lacrosse), sometimes shortened to wlax or lax, is a sport played with twelve players on each team. Originally played by indigenous peoples of the Americas, the modern women's game was introduced in 1890 at the St Leonard's School in St Andrews, Scotland. The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's field lacrosse.

The object of the game is to use a long-handled stick (known as a crosse or lacrosse stick) to catch, carry, and pass a solid rubber ball in an effort to score by hurling the ball into an opponent's goal. The head of the lacrosse stick has a mesh net strung into it that allows the player to hold the lacrosse ball. Defensively the object is to keep the opposing team from scoring and to dispossess them of the ball through the use of stick checking and body positioning. The rules of women's lacrosse are different from the men's lacrosse game. Equipment required to play is also different from the men's. Women are only required to wear eyewear/lacrosse goggles and a mouth guard. The stick has restrictions too, as it must be a certain length and the pocket not too deep.

At the collegiate level in the United States, lacrosse is represented by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which conducts an NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship each spring. Internationally women's lacrosse has a thirty-one member governing body called the Federation of International Lacrosse, which sponsors the Women's Lacrosse World Cup once every four years.

## Rules

Women’s lacrosse is played with a team of 12 players, including the goalkeeper during usual play. The ball used is typically yellow, unless both teams agree to use a different coloured ball. The duration of the game is 60 minutes, with two halves. Each team is allowed two 90-second team time-outs per game (two 2-minute timeouts in the USA). In the USA, a time-out may be requested by the head coach or any player on the field after a goal is scored or any time the requestor's team is in clear possession of the ball. If a possession timeout is called, players must leave their crosses in place on the field and return to that same place for the restart of play. No substitutions are allowed during this stoppage of play.

The rules of women's lacrosse differ significantly from men's lacrosse. The details that follow are the USA rules. International women's lacrosse rules are slightly different.

The women's lacrosse game saw numerous rule changes in 2000. Modifications included limiting the amount of players allowed between the two restraining lines on the draw to five players per team. Stick modifications have led to offset heads, which allow the women's game to move faster and makes stick moves and tricks easier. In 2002, goggles became mandatory equipment in the United States (but not a requirement in international rules). In 2006, hard boundaries were adopted.

In 2013 the rules for women's NCAA lacrosse changed a defensive rule that made the game more similar to that of the men's. Players in their defending end of the field may run through any portion of the crease (8 meter circle around the goal) as long as their team is not in possession of the ball for as long as 3 seconds. Only the defensive player who is directly marking the ball carrier within a stick’s length may remain in the crease while defending. This rule evolved the game to a point where the defense had more equality in play with both the attackers, and compared to the men's game.

## Players

Traditionally, women played with three attackers (starting with the position closest to the net that a team is shooting at, the attack positions are called "first home", "second home", and "third home"), five midfielders (a "right attack wing", a "left attack wing", a "right defensive wing", a "left defensive wing", and a "center"), three defenders (starting from the position closest to the net a team is defending, these positions are called "point", "cover point", and "third man"), and one goalie. The positions used to be pinned on the players, and the players used to be required to be marked on defense by their opposite number (third man or "3M" covering the opposing third home "3H").

Today, under the rules of North America, seven players play attack at one time and seven defenders are present. Generally, a team has four attackers, four close defenders, and three midfielders. There is a restraining line that keeps the four defensive players (plus the goalie) from going into the attack, or four attackers from going into the defensive zone. If those players cross the line and participate in the play, they are considered offside and a major foul is called.

## International competition

Beginning in 1972, the sport was governed internationally by the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations (IFWLA). The formation of the IFWLA actually predated that of the corresponding body for men's lacrosse, the International Lacrosse Federation (ILF), by two years.

In August 2008, after negotiations lasting four years, the IFWLA and ILF agreed to merge into a single governing body, the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL). All tournaments operated by the IFWLA have been taken over by the FIL.

Every four years, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup is held. It was organized by the IFWLA before its merger with the IFL, and is now organized by the FIL. The most recent edition was held in Oshawa, Canada, in 2013. The United States defeated Canada in the final.

The next World Cup will be held in Surrey, England in 2017.
